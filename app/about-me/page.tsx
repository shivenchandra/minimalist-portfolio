            I build and ship web applications that solve real problems. My work

            TypeScript, APIs and services in Node.js, and resilient
            deployments on cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. I focus on
            readable code, reliable tests, and automation so work can be

            on the frontend and backend, and automating builds and releases so
            teams can move quickly without constant firefighting.
