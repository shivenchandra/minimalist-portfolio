  // Modern engineering teams juggle multiple applications, shared modules, design systems, and utility libraries. Maintaining these assets across isolated repositories often leads to duplicated effort, version drift, and unnecessary complexity. This is where the Monorepo pattern shines. A Monorepo consolidates all your projects into a single, unified codebase, making it easier to share logic, maintain consistency, and foster cross-team collaboration.

  // ## Why Should You Care About Monorepos?

  // Imagine working across several apps, each with its own configuration, dependency versions, and deployment pipeline. Every small update becomes a scavenger hunt across repositories. If you've ever fixed a bug in one repo only to forget updating it in another, you know the pain.

  // A Monorepo simplifies all of this by storing everything in one structured environment. Think of it like turning a cluttered garage with scattered tools into a labeled, organized workshop. Suddenly, everything is where you expect it to be, and you can focus more on building than on searching.

  // Technical recruiters also appreciate Monorepo experience because it reflects your familiarity with scalable architectures, complex dependency graphs, and modern development workflows used by top engineering organizations like Google, Meta, and Uber.

  // ## Enter Turborepo: Your Build System on Steroids

  // Introducing Turborepo, a high-performance build system designed specifically for JavaScript and TypeScript Monorepos. Think of it as the ultra-efficient project manager who knows what tasks matter, which ones can be skipped, and how to get everything done as fast as possible.

  // - It caches previous builds so repeated work simply doesn’t happen.
  // - It runs tasks in parallel, similar to a skilled chef preparing multiple dishes at once.
  // - It respects dependency relationships, ensuring that tasks only execute when something relevant actually changed.

  // In practice, this means faster CI pipelines, reduced compute costs, and a smoother development experience, critical benefits for any team building multiple apps or shared packages at scale.

  // ## Getting Started in 5 Minutes

  // Here’s the quickest way to get hands-on experience with Turborepo:

  // \`\`\`bash
  // npx create-turbo@latest
  // \`\`\`

  // Running this command scaffolds a ready-to-use Monorepo with modern patterns. You'll receive a structure similar to:

  // \`\`\`bash
  // my-turborepo/
  // ├── apps/        # Applications: web apps, backend services, or anything deployable
  // ├── packages/    # Shared code: UI libraries, utils, config presets
  // ├── turbo.json   # Turborepo’s pipeline & task configuration
  // └── package.json # Root-level dependency and workspace management
  // \`\`\`

  // This structure encourages good habits early on, shared logic stays shared, versions remain consistent, and developers avoid reinventing the wheel across projects.

  // ## This Might Be Handy!

  // - Start Small: Migrate one project at a time to reduce friction and uncover potential dependency issues early.
  // - Leverage Caching: Define clear task relationships in \`turbo.json\` to dramatically reduce build and CI times.
  // - Optimize Shared Packages: Keep shared libraries modular, documented, and easy for teammates to adopt.
  // - Automate Early: Add linting, type-checking, and testing pipelines directly into your Turborepo for long-term maintainability.

  // ## Conclusion

  // Monorepos powered by Turborepo offer more than a tidy folder structure, they deliver a scalable way to build, maintain, and deploy applications with speed and consistency. They reduce the mental overhead of managing dozens of repos and help teams focus on what actually matters: shipping meaningful features.

  // Whether you're a solo developer building multiple apps or part of a large engineering organization, the advantages are undeniable. Setting everything up might take a short learning curve, but the long-term payoff in productivity, collaboration, and code quality is significant.

  // If you're curious, start small, move a single app or shared utility into a Turborepo structure and experience the difference firsthand. Your workflows will feel lighter, faster, and more organized. And yes, your future self (and your recruiter) will thank you.

  // For many developers, deployment has always felt like the final boss manual commands, complicated servers, last-minute errors, and no clear visibility into what went wrong. But DevOps practices have changed the game. With modern CI/CD pipelines, developers can ship features faster, automate repetitive tasks, and avoid the stress of late night deployments. GitHub Actions is one of the easiest and most powerful tools to bring this automation to your workflow.

  // ## Why developers should care about CI/CD?

  // Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) isn’t just a DevOps buzzword, it’s the foundation of reliable, scalable software delivery. When you automate building, testing, and deploying your code, you remove a huge amount of risk and human error.

  // Think of CI/CD as your personal automated teammate. Every time you push code, it checks your work, builds it, runs tests, and if everything looks good, deploys it for you. No more spending weekends copying files onto servers or forgetting a dependency!

  // Technical recruiters love seeing CI/CD experience because it shows that you understand modern DevOps culture, can manage deployment pipelines, and are comfortable working in production environments, skills highly valued across engineering teams today.

  // ## Why Github Actions is a top choice for CI/CD?

  // GitHub Actions brings automation directly to where your code already lives. You don’t need extra tools, complicated plugins, or external servers. Everything runs inside GitHub’s infrastructure, making it simple to automate tasks like testing, building, linting, or deploying your project to cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, or even on-prem servers.

  // - It integrates seamlessly with your repository, no third-party setup required.
  // - It supports reusable workflows, secrets management, and environment-based deployments.
  // - It is developer friendly, customizable, and scales easily with your project.

  // For teams looking to embrace DevOps or improve their deployment workflow, GitHub Actions is often the easiest on-ramp into automated pipelines.

  // ## Building a smooth deployment pipeline to ec2 instance

  // To show how simple automation can be, let’s walk through a real deployment workflow. Imagine you’re pushing updates to the main branch, and you want your server—an AWS EC2 instance to automatically receive your latest code, install dependencies, and build the project. GitHub Actions can handle all of that with just a few steps.

  // Below is an example workflow named Push-to-EC2 instance that uses \`ssh-deploy\` and the \`appleboy/ssh-action\` to automate deployment, install dependencies, build your app, and restart your server.

  // File -> .github/workflows/build.yml

  // \`\`\`yaml
  // name: Deploy to EC2

  // on:
  //   push:
  //     branches:
  //       - main

  // jobs:
  //   deploy:
  //     name: Push to EC2
  //     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  //     steps:
  //       - name: Checkout the code
  //         uses: actions/checkout@v2

  //       - name: executing remote ssh commands using private key
  //         uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.2.0
  //         with:
  //           host: 13.127.14.79
  //           username: ubuntu
  //           key: \${{ secrets.PRIVATE_SSH_KEY }}
  //           port: 22
  //           script: ./deploy.sh
  // \`\`\`

  // File -> deploy.sh

  // \`\`\`bash
  // ls
  // cd repo-ci-cd
  // git pull origin main
  // npm install
  // npm run build
  // npm run start
  // \`\`\`

  // This workflow handles everything from preparing the server to deploying the latest build. Once configured with the right secrets, you can push code and trust your pipeline to take care of the heavy lifting.

  // ## Tips to improve your Github Actions pipeline

  // - Use GitHub secrets for SSH keys, environment variables, and server details.
  // - Add workflow notifications using Slack or email to keep the team updated.
  // - Include automated tests to prevent broken code from reaching production.
  // - Use environment protections for staging and production environments.
  // - Cache dependencies to speed up build times.

  // ## Conclusion

  // CI/CD is no longer optional, it’s a core skill for modern developers. Automating your deployment workflow with GitHub Actions not only saves you time, but also makes your releases more consistent, reliable, and scalable. The more your project grows, the more you’ll appreciate having solid automation behind the scenes.

  // Whether you’re pushing updates to a personal side project or deploying production workloads on AWS, GitHub Actions gives you the tools to build a clean, dependable pipeline from code to cloud. Start small, automate one step at a time, and soon your deployments will be smooth, stress-free, and impressively professional.

  // Give it a try with your next project, your future self, your teammates, and even your next recruiter will notice the difference.

  // Real-time collaboration has become a default expectation. Whether you're editing a document with your teammates, watching multiple users interact in a dashboard, or sending messages in a chat system, the underlying backend architecture must support low latency, high throughput, and fault tolerance. But behind the scenes, real-time data is surprisingly fragile. One slow database operation, one network hiccup, and the entire collaboration experience can feel laggy or inconsistent.

  // To avoid this, high-performance systems rely on event-driven designs powered by Redis queues and worker processes. This approach ensures that user actions are acknowledged instantly, processed in the background, and saved to the database without slowing down the real-time experience.

  // ## Why Real-Time Collaboration Is Harder Than It Looks

  // Imagine a scenario: multiple users are editing the same document, updating shared dashboards, or toggling application states. Each of these operations requires saving data somewhere, usually a database. But saving to a traditional database is an asynchronous operation. Even under ideal conditions, any write can take 20 - 80 ms sometimes more.

  // Now multiply that by dozens or hundreds of concurrent users. A single database write bottleneck can introduce stutters, race conditions, or lost updates. Real-time systems must prioritize speed, consistency, and resilience. This is where message queues and worker architectures step in.

  // ## How Modern Real-Time Systems Actually Communicate

  // Most real-time collaboration tools follow a simple principle: the client should never wait for the database. Instead, user actions are instantly acknowledged through WebSockets, and the backend processes them asynchronously via a queue.

  // This decoupling guarantees a smooth user experience. Even if the database temporarily slows down, users continue working without interruptions.

  // ## Why Redis Is the Secret Weapon of Real-Time Architectures

  // Redis is not just an in-memory cache. In real-time backends, Redis often becomes the central message broker thanks to its extremely low latency (sub-millisecond operations) and built-in data structures like lists, queues, streams, and pub/sub channels.

  // - In-memory operations guarantee lightning-fast performance.
  // - Redis lists and queues act as durable queues that never block user interactions.
  // - Workers can scale horizontally, each consuming tasks from the queue.
  // - Supports pub/sub for broadcasting events across services.
  // - Eliminates the bottleneck of waiting for slow database writes.

  // ## Architecture Overview: Real-Time Collaboration With Redis + Workers

  // At a high level, real-time collaboration systems follow a multi-step architecture. The client sends an event (e.g., update document content), which the backend receives instantly. The backend then pushes the event into a Redis queue, and workers in the background take care of saving the data to the database.

  // \`\`\`bash
  // Client (WebSocket)
  //      ↓
  // Backend Gateway (Node/FastAPI/Nest)
  //      ↓  push event
  //  Redis Queue  <-------------------+|
  //      ↓                             |
  // Worker Service(s)                  |
  //      ↓                             |
  // Database (PostgreSQL/Mongo/etc) --+|
  // \`\`\`

  // This decoupled architecture ensures that even if the database becomes slow or temporarily unavailable, real-time operations never pause or get blocked.

  // ## Implementing Redis Queue: A Practical Example

  // Here’s how to build a simple Redis-backed queue using only Redis commands. No external queue libraries, just raw Redis operations for total control and minimal latency.

  // ### 1. Install Redis Client

  // \`\`\`bash
  // npm install redis
  // \`\`\`

  // ### 2. Create a Queue Producer

  // \`\`\`ts
  // import { createClient } from "redis";

  // const redis = createClient({ url: "redis://localhost:6379" });
  // await redis.connect();

  // export async function enqueueEvent(event) {
  //   // RPUSH -> Push event to end of the queue
  //   await redis.rPush("collabQueue", JSON.stringify(event));
  //   console.log("Event queued:", event);
  // }

  // // Example usage:
  // // enqueueEvent({ type: "UPDATE_CONTENT", payload: { userId: "u123", text: "Hello" } });
  // \`\`\`

  // This pushes real-time events into a Redis list instantly. The backend never waits for the database write, it simply hands off the work to the queue.

  // ### 3. Create a Worker to Process Events

  // \`\`\`ts
  // import { createClient } from "redis";
  // import { saveToDatabase } from "./db";

  // const redis = createClient({ url: "redis://localhost:6379" });
  // await redis.connect();

  // async function processQueue() {
  //   console.log("Worker started...");

  //   while (true) {
  //     // BLPOP -> Wait for next event (blocks until message arrives)
  //     const result = await redis.blPop("collabQueue", 0);

  //     if (result && result.element) {
  //       const event = JSON.parse(result.element);

  //       try {
  //         await saveToDatabase(event);
  //         console.log("Processed event:", event);
  //       } catch (err) {
  //         console.error("Failed to process event:", err);
  //         // Optionally requeue event for retry
  //         await redis.rPush("collabQueue:retry", JSON.stringify(event));
  //       }
  //     }
  //   }
  // }

  // processQueue().catch(console.error);
  // \`\`\`

  // This worker listens for incoming events using BLPOP, which efficiently blocks until a new task arrives. You can run multiple worker instances to scale horizontally, Redis handles queue ordering and distribution.

  // ## What Happens Without This Architecture?

  // - Database writes block the event loop and slow down real-time operations.
  // - Clients experience noticeable lag during peak usage.
  // - Race conditions appear when multiple users update the same entity.
  // - High traffic can overload the database and cause downtime.
  // - The entire real-time experience becomes unreliable.

  // By decoupling real-time events from database operations, you avoid these pitfalls entirely.

  // ## Bonus: Using Redis Streams for Ordered Collaboration Events

  // Redis Streams provide guaranteed ordering and consumer groups, making them perfect for multi-user collaboration sessions where event order matters.

  // Workers can read from streams in strict order, ensuring no event is processed prematurely.

  // ## Optimizing for Low Latency in Real-Time Systems

  // - Minimize payload size; send only diffs instead of full state.
  // - Use WebSockets instead of REST polling.
  // - Offload heavy computations to worker services.
  // - Store frequently accessed state in Redis instead of the database.
  // - Batch database writes in the background where possible.
  // - Leverage Redis Pub/Sub for broadcast events across user sessions.

  // Every millisecond counts in real-time apps, so each optimization compounds into a noticeably smoother experience.

  // ## Conclusion

  // Real-time collaboration requires a backend architecture that is fast, scalable, and resilient. Redis queues and worker systems provide the perfect foundation for handling rapid user interactions without overwhelming your database or degrading user experience.

  // By decoupling user events from database writes, you gain full control over processing workloads, reduce latency dramatically, and make the entire collaboration system more maintainable.

  // If you're building any system where multiple users interact in real time, adopting a Redis-backed worker architecture is not just an optimization it's a necessity. Try implementing it in a small feature first, observe the performance improvements, and scale confidently from there.

  //     content: `
  // If you've ever wondered how JavaScript manages to run non-blocking code despite being single-threaded, you're not alone. The event loop is one of the most misunderstood, yet most fundamental parts of modern web development. Whether you’re working with promises, async/await, fetch APIs, or event listeners, JavaScript’s event loop silently orchestrates it all behind the scenes.

  // Understanding the event loop is more than a technical curiosity. It helps you write efficient, predictable code, avoid performance bottlenecks, debug async behavior, and speak fluently in technical interviews. So let’s walk through what actually happens under the hood when JavaScript executes your program.

  // ## Why Is JavaScript Single-Threaded?

  // JavaScript was originally designed to run inside the browser. Because multiple scripts manipulating the DOM simultaneously could cause chaos, early designers chose a single-threaded execution model. That means only one piece of JavaScript code runs at a time, no true parallel execution inside the main thread.

  // But this raises a question: how can single-threaded JavaScript handle asynchronous tasks like fetching data or waiting for timers without freezing the UI? The answer lies in the event loop and the task queue system.

  // ## The JavaScript Runtime: More Than Just the Engine

  // JavaScript doesn’t work alone. The runtime environment, whether it’s the browser or Node.js, includes several powerful components:

  // - The Call Stack (where synchronous code runs)
  // - The Heap (memory allocation)
  // - Web APIs (browser features like timers, fetch, DOM events)
  // - The Task Queue (callback queue)
  // - The Microtask Queue (for promises and microtasks)
  // - The Event Loop (the traffic controller)

  // Only the call stack is part of the actual JavaScript engine. Everything else is provided by the environment around it, enabling JavaScript to behave asynchronously.

  // ## The Call Stack: Where Execution Begins

  // The call stack is the heart of synchronous JavaScript execution. Whenever a function is called, it’s pushed onto the stack. When it finishes, it's popped off. JavaScript runs line by line, top to bottom, until the stack is empty.

  // \`\`\`js
  // function a() { b(); }
  // function b() { console.log("Running"); }
  // a();
  // \`\`\`

  // But the stack is not where asynchronous operations run. Timers, network calls, and event handlers don't sit on the stack waiting, they are handled elsewhere.

  // ## Where Async Really Happens: Browser APIs

  // When you call setTimeout, fetch, or addEventListener, JavaScript doesn’t actually process them. Instead, the browser takes over. These operations run inside Web APIs, an independent set of threads and systems that manage external or timed actions while keeping the JavaScript thread free.

  // - setTimeout waits using browser timers
  // - fetch uses the network layer
  // - event listeners trigger on UI or system events
  // - promises resolve through the microtask scheduler

  // When an API finishes its job, it doesn't execute the callback directly. Instead, it pushes the callback into one of the queue systems, the task queue or the microtask queue.

  // ## The Task Queue: Where Callbacks Wait Their Turn

  // The task queue is a simple FIFO queue where callbacks from asynchronous operations sit until JavaScript is ready to execute them. Tasks in this queue include:

  // - setTimeout callbacks
  // - setInterval callbacks
  // - DOM event callbacks
  // - Fetch API callbacks
  // - MessageChannel tasks

  // Callbacks only move from the task queue to the call stack when the stack is completely empty. That means JavaScript finishes all synchronous work before executing async callbacks.

  // ## But There’s a Second Queue: The Microtask Queue

  // Promises, queueMicrotask, and MutationObservers do not go into the task queue. They go into the microtask queue, which has higher priority.

  // - Promise.then
  // - Promise.catch
  // - async/await continuation blocks
  // - queueMicrotask

  // Before the event loop pulls anything from the task queue, it drains the microtask queue completely. This is why promises often appear to run 'faster' than setTimeout.

  // ## Event Loop: The Traffic Controller

  // The event loop continuously monitors the call stack and the microtask/task queues. Its job is simple:

  // - If the call stack is NOT empty → do nothing.
  // - If the call stack is empty → run all available microtasks.
  // - If microtasks are empty → pull the next task from the task queue.

  // This cycle runs indefinitely, ensuring JavaScript does not block when waiting for asynchronous operations.

  // ## A Visual Overview

  // \`\`\`txt
  // Call Stack (JS Engine)
  //      ↓ empty?
  // Microtask Queue (Promises, async/await)
  //      ↓ drained?
  // Task Queue (Timers, Events)
  //      ↓
  // Event Loop (decides what runs next)
  // \`\`\`

  // ## Example: Can You Predict the Output?

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.log("Start");

  // setTimeout(() => {
  //   console.log("Timeout");
  // }, 0);

  // Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  //   console.log("Promise");
  // });

  // console.log("End");
  // \`\`\`

  // Many developers expect the timeout to run before the promise. But the actual output reveals the microtask queue’s priority.

  // \`\`\`txt
  // Start
  // End
  // Promise
  // Timeout
  // \`\`\`

  // This happens because promises are microtasks, and microtasks run before any task-queue item such as setTimeout, even when the timeout is set to 0ms.

  // ## Async/Await: Syntactic Sugar for Promises

  // Async/await may look like synchronous code, but under the hood it's powered entirely by promises and microtasks. Whenever JavaScript hits an await keyword, it pauses execution of that function and schedules the next step as a microtask.

  // \`\`\`js
  // async function load() {
  //   console.log("1");
  //   await null;
  //   console.log("2");
  // }
  // load();
  // console.log("3");
  // \`\`\`

  // Because awaiting schedules a microtask, the output becomes:

  // \`\`\`txt
  // 1
  // 3
  // 2
  // \`\`\`

  // ## How the Browser Handles Asynchronous Operations

  // The browser plays a huge role in enabling JavaScript’s non-blocking behavior. Each async action uses a different browser subsystem:

  // - Networking threads handle fetch() calls.
  // - Timer threads handle setTimeout and setInterval.
  // - Render and input threads handle UI clicks, scrolls, and paint cycles.
  // - MutationObserver and microtasks run in the microtask checkpoint.
  // - IndexedDB operations run in dedicated background threads.

  // Once these operations finish, they hand results back to JavaScript by pushing callbacks into the appropriate queue, never directly onto the call stack.

  // ## Why Understanding the Event Loop Matters for Developers

  // - It prevents race conditions and unexpected async behavior.
  // - It helps you optimize rendering performance.
  // - It explains why some code seems to run 'out of order'.
  // - It enables writing responsive, non-blocking UI code.
  // - It helps you avoid microtask starvation and infinite loops.
  // - It helps during coding interviews (a favorite topic!).

  // ## Conclusion

  // Behind JavaScript’s friendly syntax lies a sophisticated orchestration system that keeps your apps smooth, responsive, and predictable. The event loop, the task queue, and the microtask queue work together to ensure JavaScript never blocks and always knows what to run next.

  // By understanding how these components interact, especially how browsers handle async operations, you gain the power to write faster, cleaner, and more reliable code. Whether you’re optimizing animations, managing API calls, or preparing for a backend or frontend interview, mastering the event loop will elevate your engineering maturity.

  // The next time your code behaves unexpectedly, don’t guess, check the queues.

  // PostgreSQL, or Postgres, is one of the most powerful, reliable, and feature-rich relational databases available today. Whether you're building small projects or enterprise-level applications, understanding Postgres at both the CLI and the code level can make your life as a developer much easier.

  // In this article, we’ll explore not only how to use PostgreSQL effectively but also dive into some essential CLI commands (\`\\d\`, \`\\c\`, \`\\l\`, \`\\x\`) that every developer should know. Plus, we’ll touch on how asynchronous processes in JavaScript interact with databases in the browser context, providing a full-stack perspective.

  // ## Why PostgreSQL is a Developer Favorite

  // Postgres stands out for several reasons: it’s open-source, ACID-compliant, and extremely versatile. It supports advanced features like JSONB storage, full-text search, and procedural functions while maintaining high reliability.

  // - Strong SQL compliance with rich indexing options.
  // - Support for advanced data types and extensions (PostGIS, pgcrypto).
  // - Active community and extensive documentation.
  // - Scalable for both small projects and enterprise-grade applications.

  // ## Getting Started with the Postgres CLI

  // Postgres comes with a command-line client called \`psql\`. Knowing a few key commands can drastically improve your workflow, whether you’re inspecting database schemas, switching between databases, or running quick queries.

  // ### 1. List All Databases: \\l

  // The \`\\l\` command lists all databases in your Postgres server. It’s useful when you’re connecting to a new environment or checking what databases exist on your instance.

  // \`\`\`sql
  // postgres=# \\l
  //                            List of databases
  //    Name    |  Owner   | Encoding |   Collate   |    Ctype    |   Access privileges   
  // -----------+----------+----------+------------+------------+-----------------------
  //  mydb      | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 | 
  //  postgres  | postgres | UTF8     | en_US.UTF-8 | en_US.UTF-8 |
  // \`\`\`

  // ### 2. Connect to a Database: \\c

  // To switch databases within \`psql\`, use \`\\c <database_name>\`. This is faster than exiting and reconnecting, and allows you to run queries in different databases without leaving the CLI.

  // \`\`\`sql
  // postgres=# \\c mydb
  // You are now connected to database "mydb" as user "postgres".
  // \`\`\`

  // ### 3. View Table Structures: \\d

  // The \`\\d\` command displays the schema of a table, including columns, types, and constraints. This is essential for understanding the database structure, especially in large applications or when joining unfamiliar tables.

  // \`\`\`sql
  // mydb=# \\d users
  //          Table "public.users"
  //  Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
  // --------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
  //  id     | serial  |           | not null | 
  //  name   | text    |           |          | 
  //  email  | text    |           |          | 
  // Indexes:
  //     "users_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
  // \`\`\`

  // ### 4. Expand Table Details for Readability: \\x

  // The \`\\x\` command toggles extended display in \`psql\`. When enabled, query results are displayed vertically, making wide tables or long outputs easier to read.

  // \`\`\`sql
  // mydb=# \\x
  // Expanded display is on.
  // mydb=# SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
  // -[ RECORD 1 ]-------------------------
  // id    | 1
  // name  | John Doe
  // email | john@example.com
  // \`\`\`

  // ## Best Practices for Using Postgres Effectively

  // Using Postgres efficiently isn’t just about running queries. It involves schema design, indexing, and careful handling of asynchronous operations in your applications.

  // - Design tables with meaningful constraints and indexes to speed up queries.
  // - Use transactions for multiple related operations to maintain consistency.
  // - Analyze query performance using \`EXPLAIN\` and \`EXPLAIN ANALYZE\`.
  // - Leverage JSONB when storing flexible, semi-structured data.
  // - Regularly vacuum and monitor your database for bloat and performance issues.

  // ## JavaScript and Asynchronous Database Operations

  // When your Node.js backend communicates with Postgres, queries are asynchronous, meaning the server can handle other requests while waiting for the database response. Node.js uses non-blocking I/O under the hood, allowing your backend to efficiently process multiple database operations without freezing the server.

  // For example, using \`async/await\` or Promises with a Postgres client library like \`pg\` ensures that your application remains responsive, even when performing long-running queries.

  // \`\`\`js
  // const { Client } = require('pg');

  // async function getUsers() {
  //   const client = new Client();
  //   await client.connect();
  //   const res = await client.query('SELECT * FROM users');
  //   console.log(res.rows);
  //   await client.end();
  // }

  // getUsers();
  // console.log('Query sent, waiting for results...');
  // \`\`\`

  // In this example, the console will immediately print 'Query sent, waiting for results...' while the database query runs asynchronously.

  // ## Tips for Smooth Workflow with Postgres CLI

  // - Combine \`\\d\` with \`\\x\` for more readable table structures.
  // - Use \`\\c\` to switch databases without quitting \`psql\`.
  // - List all databases with \`\\l\` to quickly verify environments.
  // - Create scripts for common queries to save time.
  // - Use aliases or shell scripts to automate frequent database connections.

  // ## Conclusion

  // PostgreSQL is a powerful tool for developers, but mastering it requires more than just writing queries. Using the CLI effectively with commands like \`\\d\`, \`\\c\`, \`\\l\`, and \`\\x\` gives you insight into your database structure and workflow, while following best practices ensures performance and maintainability.

  // Start small, experiment with CLI commands, monitor your queries, and watch how much more control you gain over your Postgres environment.

  // If you're a JavaScript developer, whether you're building a fresh project, fixing a tricky bug, or preparing for an interview, the console is your best friend. Most of us rely heavily on \`console.log()\`, but the console API is far richer than that. Knowing how to use all the logging tools smartly can help you debug faster, understand complex data structures better, and impress technical interviewers.

  // In this complete guide, we’ll explore all the essential console methods: \`console.log()\`, \`console.info()\`, \`console.warn()\`, \`console.error()\`, \`console.debug()\`, \`console.trace()\`, \`console.table()\`, timers with \`console.time()\`, groups with \`console.group()\`, counters with \`console.count()\`, and even how \`console.clear()\` works. By the end, you’ll be logging like a pro.

  // ## Why Console Logging Still Matters in 2025

  // Even with advanced debugging tools in Chrome DevTools, VS Code, and various profiling utilities, console logging remains one of the fastest and most reliable ways to understand what your code is doing. It’s simple, quick, and always available, whether you’re debugging a massive React app, a backend Node.js service, or an experimental script.

  // ## 1. console.log(): The Classic Debugging Tool

  // \`console.log()\` is the most widely used console method, helpful for printing messages, variables, and objects.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.log("User logged in:", user);
  // \`\`\`

  // However, many developers don’t know that \`console.log()\` also supports string formatting similar to printf.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.log("Hello %s, your score is %d", "Aman", 95);
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 2. console.info(): Log Informational Messages

  // \`console.info()\` works like \`console.log()\` but is semantically used for informational messages.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.info("Server started on port 8080");
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 3. console.warn(): Highlight Non-Critical Issues

  // \`console.warn()\` is ideal for warnings that don’t break the app but require attention, deprecated functions, slow operations, or unexpected inputs.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.warn("Password strength is weak");
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 4. console.error(): Show Errors Clearly

  // When something goes wrong, \`console.error()\` prints messages in red with a stack trace in most browsers. Use it to highlight actual failures.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.error("Failed to fetch data:", error);
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 5. console.debug(): Debugging in Development Mode

  // \`console.debug()\` is similar to log but may be hidden in production console settings. It’s good for low-priority debug messages.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.debug("Rendered footer component");
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 6. console.trace(): Print the Call Stack Instantly

  // \`console.trace()\` prints the function call stack leading up to that point, super useful for locating unexpectedly triggered functions.

  // \`\`\`js
  // function test() {
  //   console.trace("Where am I being called from?");
  // }
  // test();
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 7. console.table(): Visualize Arrays and Objects Like a Pro

  // \`console.table()\` renders arrays or objects in a neat table format. This is extremely useful for debugging large datasets or API responses.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.table([
  //   { id: 1, name: "Aman", score: 91 },
  //   { id: 2, name: "Riya", score: 87 }
  // ]);
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 8. console.count() and console.countReset(): Count Execution Frequency

  // \`console.count()\` shows how many times a label has been executed. Great for tracking loops or function calls.

  // \`\`\`js
  // function greet() {
  //   console.count("greet called");
  // }
  // greet();
  // greet();
  // console.countReset("greet called");
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 9. console.time(), console.timeEnd(), console.timeLog(): Measure Performance

  // These methods let you track how long operations take, useful when optimizing performance or measuring slow API calls.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.time("db-query");
  // await fetchData();
  // console.timeLog("db-query");
  // console.timeEnd("db-query");
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 10. console.group() and console.groupEnd(): Organize Logs for Clarity

  // With nested operations, logs can get messy. \`console.group()\` lets you visually group related logs, making debugging cleaner.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.group("User Info");
  // console.log("Name:", "Aman");
  // console.log("Role:", "Admin");
  // console.groupEnd();
  // \`\`\`

  // ## 11. console.clear(): Clean the Screen

  // \`console.clear()\` refreshes the console, useful during repeated debugging cycles. Some browsers show a confirmation message.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.clear();
  // \`\`\`

  // ## Bonus: Styling Logs for Better Visibility

  // Did you know you can style console logs using CSS? This is very useful for highlighting logs in large applications.

  // \`\`\`js
  // console.log("%cSuccess!", "color: green; font-weight: bold;");
  // \`\`\`

  // ## Real World Tips for Debugging with Console Logs

  // - Use console groups for complex workflows.
  // - Use console.table() for API results.
  // - Avoid leaving console.log() in production code.
  // - Use console.time() to benchmark expensive operations.
  // - Prefer console.warn() and console.error() for proper log severity.

  // ## Conclusion

  // Mastering JavaScript console methods isn’t just about logging values. It’s about improving your debugging efficiency, writing cleaner code, and communicating intent clearly. These console techniques are used every single day by senior developers, and understanding them deeply will make you a stronger engineer, whether you're working on frontend, backend, or full-stack projects.

  // The next time you debug an issue, try exploring beyond \`console.log()\`. You might be surprised at how much time you save and how professional your workflow becomes.

  // If you’ve been building modern web apps, whether a frontend in React or a backend in Node.js, FastAPI, or Go, you’ve definitely faced that infamous error: “CORS policy: Access to fetch at…”. For many developers, CORS feels like a random wall the browser throws up. But under the hood, CORS is actually a well-structured security system designed to protect users, not frustrate developers.

  // In this guide, we’ll break down what CORS is, why it exists, how it actually works internally, and the problems it solves. By the end, you’ll understand exactly what your browser does during a CORS request and how servers decide whether to allow or block it. This is the kind of deep understanding tech recruiters love to see, especially for backend, full-stack, and platform engineering roles.

  // ## What Exactly Is CORS?

  // CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, is a browser security mechanism. It governs how a web page from one origin (domain + protocol + port) can request resources from another origin. Without CORS, any website could freely make requests to any backend you’re logged into, bank accounts, emails, social media, and silently read the responses. CLEARLY DANGEROUS!

  // CORS acts as a protective layer on top of HTTP, preventing malicious cross-site requests while still allowing legitimate communication across domains like API gateways, microservices, CDNs, and SPA frontends.

  // ## Why Does CORS Even Exist?

  // To understand CORS, you need to first understand the Same-Origin Policy (SOP). SOP is a strict browser rule that blocks JavaScript running in one origin from reading data from another origin. It’s one of the most important security walls of the modern web.

  // But as applications evolved, the web needed a secure way to allow APIs on different domains, like \`api.myapp.com\`, CDNs, authentication servers, and 3rd-party integrations, to communicate with frontends. That's where CORS steps in.

  // - SOP = "block everything unless it’s the same origin"
  // - CORS = "open some doors, but only when the server explicitly allows it"

  // ## What Happens During a CORS Request? (The Real Under-the-Hood Flow)

  // Every cross-origin request triggers a multi-step check inside the browser. These steps run before the request reaches your backend logic. Developers often assume CORS is enforced by the server, but in reality, the browser is the true gatekeeper.

  // ### 1. Browser Adds the Origin Header

  // When your frontend makes a request, the browser automatically attaches the \`Origin\` header:

  // \`\`\`txt
  // Origin: https://frontend-app.com
  // \`\`\`

  // This tells the backend, “Hey, this request came from this domain, are we allowed?”

  // ### 2. Does the Browser Need a Preflight Request?

  // For many requests, especially those with custom headers or methods like \`PUT\`, \`PATCH\`, or \`DELETE\`, the browser first sends an OPTIONS preflight request. This checks whether the target server allows the real request.

  // \`\`\`txt
  // OPTIONS /api/data HTTP/1.1
  // Origin: https://frontend-app.com
  // Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
  // Access-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type
  // \`\`\`

  // If the server approves, it responds with the appropriate CORS headers. If not, the browser simply blocks the request before your backend code even runs.

  // \`\`\`txt
  // HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
  // Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend-app.com
  // Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT, GET, POST
  // Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type
  // Access-Control-Max-Age: 600
  // \`\`\`

  // \`Access-Control-Max-Age\` lets the browser cache the preflight result for faster subsequent requests. This improves performance significantly.

  // ### 3. Simple Requests (No Preflight)

  // Not all CORS requests require a preflight. "Simple requests", such as \`GET\`, \`POST\`, or \`HEAD\` with no custom headers, go straight to the server. The browser only checks the response headers afterward.

  // ### 4. Browser Validates Server Response

  // If the server sends back \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\` and (if needed) \`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials\`, the browser allows JavaScript to read the response. Otherwise, it blocks access, even if the server returned data successfully!

  // \`\`\`txt
  // HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  // Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://frontend-app.com
  // Content-Type: application/json
  // \`\`\`

  // This final validation ensures that even if a server accidentally exposes data, the browser prevents malicious websites from reading it.

  // ## What Problems Does CORS Actually Solve?

  // - Stops malicious websites from hijacking user sessions (no silent API calls to banking, social, email accounts)
  // - Prevents Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) data leaks
  // - Gives servers full control over who can access their APIs
  // - Enables safe access to multi-origin architectures** (SPA + API + CDN setups)
  // - Allows 3rd-party integrations while keeping user data secure

  // ## Common Misunderstandings About CORS

  // - CORS is not a server-side security barrier, it's a browser side enforcement.
  // - Backend code still executes even if CORS blocks the response.
  // - CORS doesn't affect mobile apps, backend requests, or Postman.
  // - CORS is not meant to hide APIs; it's meant to control who can read the responses.

  // ## How Backend Servers Decide CORS Rules

  // On the backend side, you explicitly configure which origins, methods, and headers are allowed. Here’s how a Node.js Express setup typically looks:

  // \`\`\`javascript
  // import cors from "cors";
  // import express from "express";

  // const app = express();

  // app.use(
  //   cors({
  //     origin: ["https://frontend-app.com"],
  //     methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE],
  //     credentials: true,
  //   })
  // );

  // app.listen(8000);
  // \`\`\`

  // The same concept applies to Django, Spring Boot, FastAPI, Laravel, or Go: the server defines access rules, and the browser enforces them.

  // ## Final Thoughts: CORS Isn't the Enemy, It’s a Safety Net

  // CORS can feel annoying when you're building quickly and something breaks. But once you understand how the browser, the server, and the HTTP protocol work together, CORS becomes much easier to work with. It’s not a bug or a hurdle, it’s a protection layer that ensures users’ data stays safe while still enabling modern, distributed web applications.

  // With this deep knowledge of CORS internals, you're not just fixing errors, you’re building secure systems that scale. And trust me, that's something every technical interviewer and recruiter values highly.

  // If you've ever prepared for a JavaScript interview, you've definitely heard the question: "What are closures?" For many developers, closures feel like this mysterious superpower hidden deep inside JavaScript. But once you understand them properly, you'll realise closures are actually one of the most elegant, practical, and powerful mechanisms in the language.

  // In this blog, we'll break down closures in a simple, conversational, human-friendly way, no jargon overload, no textbook vibe. Just clear explanations, relatable examples, and recruiter impressing insights that show you truly understand the language.

  // ## So… What Exactly Are Closures?

  // A closure is created when a function remembers the variables from the place where it was created, even after that outer function has finished executing. In simpler words:

  // 👉 A closure is when JavaScript gives a function the superpower to access its outer scope even after the scope is gone.

  // \`\`\`javascript
  // function greet(name) {
  //   return function () {
  //     console.log("Hello " + name);
  //   };
  // }

  // const sayHello = greet("Abhoy");
  // sayHello();  // Output: Hello Abhoy
  // \`\`\`

  // Even though \`greet()\` has finished executing, the inner function still remembers the value of \`name\`. That's closure in action. This is why closures are often described as functions bundled with lexical scope.

  // ## Why Are Closures So Important?

  // Closures are everywhere, callbacks, event listeners, state management, private variables, debouncing, throttling, currying, and more. When recruiters see 'solid understanding of closures' on your resume, it signals that you deeply understand JavaScript's execution model and not just syntax.

  // - They help maintain state without polluting the global scope.
  // - They enable private variables and encapsulation in JavaScript.
  // - They allow powerful functional programming patterns.
  // - They make your code more predictable and modular.
  // - They're heavily used in real-world frameworks and libraries.

  // ## Let's Understand Closures with a Practical Analogy

  // Imagine you're at a restaurant. You place an order, and the waiter writes it down. Even after leaving your table, the waiter still remembers your order because it's stored in their notepad. That notepad is the closure.

  // The waiter (inner function) keeps the notepad (outer scope variables) with them, even after leaving your table (outer function finished executing).

  // ## How Closures Work Under the Hood

  // Closures rely on two core concepts in JavaScript: lexical scoping and the execution context. JavaScript decides variable scope at the time you write the code, not at runtime. And whenever a function is created, it carries a reference to the environment in which it was defined.

  // So even when the outer function finishes, JavaScript doesn't garbage collect those variables if they are still being referenced by an inner function.

  // ### Example: A Counter Using Closures

  // \`\`\`javascript
  // function createCounter() {
  //   let count = 0;

  //   return function () {
  //     count++;
  //     console.log(count);
  //   };
  // }

  // const counter = createCounter();
  // counter(); // 1
  // counter(); // 2
  // counter(); // 3
  // \`\`\`

  // Here, the \`count\` variable lives inside the closure. It's private and cannot be accessed directly from outside. This is one of the most powerful uses of closures, creating truly private state.

  // ## Real-World Use Cases of Closures

  // Closures are not just a theoretical interview question, they're used daily in real-world development. Here are some practical examples:

  // - Debouncing (e.g., search input)
  // - Throttling (e.g., scroll or resize events)
  // - Private variables in JavaScript classes or modules
  // - Callback functions
  // - Event listeners that need access to outer scope
  // - Memoization for optimization

  // ## Debounce Example Using Closures

  // Here's a simple debounce function demonstrating closures in action:

  // \`\`\`javascript
  // function debounce(fn, delay) {
  //   let timer;

  //   return function (...args) {
  //     clearTimeout(timer);
  //     timer = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  //   };
  // }

  // const logSearch = debounce(() => console.log("Searching..."), 300);
  // \`\`\`

  // \`timer\` stays alive inside the closure, allowing the function to remember previous calls. Without closures, this would be impossible.

  // ## Common Mistakes Developers Make with Closures

  // - Using closures unintentionally and causing memory leaks.
  // - Creating closures inside loops without understanding scope.
  // - Mixing up block scope (\`let\`, \`const\`) and function scope (\`var\`).
  // - Returning functions without realising they retain references.

  // ### Example: Closure Issue in Loops

  // \`\`\`javascript
  // for (var i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  //   setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
  // }

  // // Output: 4 4 4 (not 1 2 3)
  // \`\`\`

  // Because \`var\` is function-scoped, all timeout callbacks share the same \`i\`. With \`let\`, which is block-scoped, each iteration gets its own copy.

  // \`\`\`javascript
  // for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
  //   setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000);
  // }

  // // Output: 1 2 3
  // \`\`\`

  // ## When Should You Use Closures?

  // Closures are ideal when you want logic that remembers context, maintains state, or encapsulates data. They shine in scenarios like APIs, event-driven code, utility functions, and reusable helpers.

  // - Use closures to hide implementation details.
  // - Use them to maintain state across function calls.
  // - Use them when writing reusable logic like debouncers or memoization.

  // ## Conclusion: Closures Are the Secret Sauce of JavaScript

  // Closures may look intimidating at first, but once you grasp the idea that functions remember where they come from, everything falls into place. They give JavaScript its expressive power, allowing developers to write elegant, modular, and efficient code.

  // If you're preparing for interviews or building scalable real-world apps, understanding closures deeply will instantly set you apart. Recruiters love candidates who can explain closures with confidence because it shows mastery, not just familiarity, with the language.

  // So try writing a few closure-based utilities yourself. Once you get the hang of it, closures will become one of your favourite features of JavaScript.

  // AI-powered applications today go far beyond casual chatbots. From enterprise assistants to automated content generation, developers need backends that are fast, reliable, explainable, and easy to scale. This is exactly where RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and LangGraph shine. Pair them with FastAPI, and you get a modern, production-ready AI backend architecture that's clean, modular.

  // ## Why RAG Matters in 2025

  // LLMs are powerful, but they hallucinate,especially when asked about domain-specific or time-sensitive information. Instead of blindly trusting model memory, RAG enhances LLMs by grounding the responses with real documents, embeddings, and vector-based search. This makes your system more accurate, cost-efficient, and deterministic, qualities engineering teams highly value.

  // At its core, RAG does three simple things: it retrieves relevant context, feeds it into the LLM, and ensures the output stays factual. But building a robust RAG system isn't just about the algorithm, it requires a workflow engine. This is where LangGraph enters the picture.

  // ## LangGraph: The Missing Piece of Modern AI Workflows

  // LangGraph helps you build structured, deterministic AI workflows using a graph-based execution model. Instead of writing endless nested functions or messy agent logic, you get a clear, node-based pipeline that's easy to debug and scale.

  // - Define nodes for embedding, searching, prompting, decision-making, or tool execution.
  // - Easily orchestrate branching logic and multi-step LLM reasoning.
  // - Persist conversation state for long-running or multimodal AI workflows.
  // - Run workflows safely with retries, guards, memory management, and observability.

  // If you imagine your AI pipeline as a flowchart, LangGraph is the engine that executes each step predictably. This makes your entire system production-ready.

  // ## Why FastAPI Is the Perfect Match

  // FastAPI offers everything you want in a modern backend: speed, type-safety, async support, and a clean developer experience. It feels very developer friendly, straightforward, elegant, and FAST.

  // When you combine FastAPI with LangGraph, you get a backend that can host complex AI orchestration while still exposing clean REST endpoints like \`/chat\`, \`/query\`, or \`/process-document\`.

  // ## Architecture Overview

  // Let's break down a typical LangGraph + RAG + FastAPI pipeline that most production teams use:

  // - User sends a query → FastAPI endpoint
  // - Vector Search → Retrieve top-k relevant chunks from Chromadb (or any vectorDB)
  // - LangGraph Workflow → Combine retrieved context + model reasoning
  // - LLM Generation → Produce accurate final answer
  // - Storage Layer → Persist conversation history, logs, metadata

  // ## Minimal Example: FastAPI + LangGraph RAG Flow

  // \`\`\`python
  // from fastapi import FastAPI
  // from langgraph.graph import Graph
  // from langchain_community.vectorstores import Chroma
  // from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings

  // app = FastAPI()

  // # Setup vector DB and embedding model
  // emb = OpenAIEmbeddings()
  // db = Chroma(collection_name="docs", embedding_function=emb)

  // llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1")

  // graph = Graph()

  // @graph.node
  // def retrieve_node(state):
  //     query = state["query"]
  //     docs = db.similarity_search(query, k=5)
  //     return {"docs": docs}

  // @graph.node
  // def generate_node(state):
  //     docs = state["docs"]
  //     prompt = f"Context: {docs}\\nQuestion: {state['query']}"
  //     result = llm.predict(prompt)
  //     return {"answer": result}

  // graph.add_edge(retrieve_node, generate_node)

  // @app.post("/chat")
  // async def chat_api(payload: dict):
  //     result = graph.invoke({"query": payload["message"]})
  //     return {"response": result["answer"]}
  // \`\`\`

  // The above workflow is simple, readable, and easy to extend with more nodes—like rerankers, guards, tools, or conversation memory. This is the exact pattern used in real-world AI assistants and document-processing automation systems.

  // ## Real-World Use Cases of LangGraph + RAG + FastAPI

  // - Enterprise Knowledge Assistants – HR, legal, finance teams running internal Q&A
  // - Document Search Systems – PDFs, contracts, manuals, SOPs
  // - Chat with your Data Apps – Beautiful addition for SaaS dashboards
  // - Video RAG with Whisper + LangGraph – Extract transcripts → embed → chat
  // - Support Automation – Summaries, routing, intent detection

  // If you mention these use-cases in your resume or portfolio, technical recruiters immediately know you've worked with real AI infrastructure, not just toy projects.

  // ## Best Practices for Production RAG Systems

  // - Break the pipeline into clear LangGraph nodes, don't overload one function.
  // - Use hybrid search: embeddings + keyword filters + metadata.
  // - Chunk documents smartly (300–500 tokens usually works best).
  // - Add guards and validation nodes to reduce hallucinations.
  // - Persist conversations for multi-step reasoning.
  // - Cache embeddings and search queries to save cost.
  // - Use FastAPI's async endpoints for high concurrency.

  // Following these practices ensures your AI backend stays efficient, scalable, and highly maintainable in production.

  // ## Conclusion

  // RAG, LangGraph, and FastAPI form one of the most powerful stacks for building intelligent backend systems. Whether you're building an internal AI assistant, search engine, automation bot, or data-analysis tool, this stack gives you predictable workflows and blazing-fast performance. And more importantly, it levels up your engineering profile dramatically.

  // If you want to stand out in your next interview, showcase a LangGraph + RAG + FastAPI project. It signals that you understand real AI architecture, orchestration, and production readiness, all of which are highly valued in 2025.

  // Building secure authentication is one of the most important responsibilities of backend developers today. With cyberattacks increasing, companies—even startups—expect developers to know how to build authentication systems that are safe, scalable, and production-ready. And one of the fastest ways to grab the attention of a technical recruiter is to show a backend project where authentication is implemented *properly*, not just with the basic “store JWT in localStorage” method.

  // But here's the truth most beginners don’t know: **storing tokens in localStorage is not secure**, especially for real-world apps. If your goal is to build a real backend in 2025—something that looks good on GitHub and your resume—then cookie-based authentication with access & refresh tokens is the way to go.

  // In this blog, we break down everything in a simple, human-friendly manner (Indian English tone), explain why cookies are safer, and walk through how a TypeScript backend handles a modern token-based login system.

  // ---

  // # Why Authentication Needs to Be Secure in 2025

  // Whether you are building an e-commerce backend, SaaS dashboard, internal tool, or even a portfolio project, authentication is one part recruiters check very seriously. They want to see:

  // - You understand how JWT works  
  // - You know the risks of XSS & CSRF  
  // - You can build refresh-token rotation  
  // - You know how to protect APIs in production  
  // - You don’t store sensitive data in the browser  

  // A backend with proper cookie-based authentication immediately signals **professional engineering practices**.

  // Let’s first understand the core issue with the old-school method.

  // ---

  // # Why Storing JWT Tokens in localStorage Is Not Safe

  // LocalStorage is convenient, yes. But convenience often sacrifices security.

  // ## ❌ 1. localStorage Is Fully Accessible to JavaScript
  // This means:

  // If your site has *any* XSS vulnerability, attackers can simply run:
  // \`\`\`js
  // localStorage.getItem("access_token")
  // \`\`\`

  // Boom. They now have full access to the user’s account.

  // This is why companies DO NOT allow storing JWTs in localStorage for production, especially in fintech, healthcare, and enterprise apps.

  // ## ❌ 2. XSS Attacks Are Far More Common Than People Think
  // A single small mistake like:

  // - Unescaped user input  
  // - Vulnerable third-party scripts  
  // - Uncontrolled HTML injection  

  // …is enough for an attacker to steal your tokens.

  // ## ❌ 3. Tokens in localStorage Never Expire Automatically  
  // If someone steals the token, they can keep using it until it expires.

  // ## ❌ 4. Browser Extensions Can Access localStorage
  // Extensions with the right permissions can read all localStorage values.
  // (This is more common than you think.)

  // ---

  // # Why Cookie-Based Authentication Is More Secure

  // Modern backend engineers use **HTTP-Only, Secure cookies** to store tokens.

  // These cookies come with superpowers you don’t get in localStorage:

  // ### ✔️ 1. JavaScript Cannot Access the Cookie
  // The flag:
  // \`\`\`
  // HttpOnly
  // \`\`\`
  // makes it invisible to JavaScript.

  // Even if your site has XSS vulnerability, attackers cannot steal the cookie.

  // ### ✔️ 2. Protects Against Most Token-Theft Attacks  
  // No JS access → No simple token stealing.

  // ### ✔️ 3. Automatically Sent with Requests  
  // You don’t manually attach cookies. Browsers handle it, making the developer's life easier and the system cleaner.

  // ### ✔️ 4. Works Perfectly with Refresh Token Rotation  
  // The refresh token stays safe inside httpOnly cookies, protected from external access.


  // When recruiters see cookies + refresh tokens, they understand you know the real stuff.

  // ---

  // # Understanding the Access Token + Refresh Token Workflow

  // A modern authentication system uses **two tokens**:

  // ## 🔐 Access Token (short-lived)
  // - Lifespan: 5–15 minutes  
  // - Sent with every API request  
  // - Used to verify the user quickly  
  // - If stolen, damage is limited due to short life  

  // ## 🔐 Refresh Token (long-lived)
  // - Lifespan: Days or weeks  
  // - Stored only in HTTP-Only cookies  
  // - Used to create a new access token  
  // - Rotated regularly to reduce risk  

  // When your access token expires, you automatically refresh it without forcing the user to log in again.

  // This creates a smooth UX + very strong security.

  // ---

  // # Full Authentication Flow (Explained Simply)

  // Here’s what happens during login:

  // 1. User logs in with email/password  
  // 2. Backend verifies credentials  
  // 3. Backend creates:
  //    - Access token (short life)
  //    - Refresh token (long life)
  // 4. Refresh token is stored in an HTTP-only secure cookie  
  // 5. Access token is sent to the frontend (or also set in a cookie)
  // 6. User can now make authenticated requests  
  // 7. When access token expires → frontend silently calls **/refresh**  
  // 8. Backend validates refresh token from cookie  
  // 9. New tokens are generated  
  // 10. User continues without interruptions  

  // This is the architecture used everywhere in production today.

  // ---

  // # TypeScript Example: Cookie-Based JWT Auth

  // Below is a small but professional-style backend example using Express + TypeScript:

  // \`\`\`ts
  // import express from "express";
  // import jwt from "jsonwebtoken";
  // import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";
  // import cors from "cors";

  // const app = express();
  // app.use(
  //   cors({
  //     origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL!,
  //     credentials: true, // allow cookies
  //     methods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
  //     allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
  //     exposedHeaders: ["Authorization"],
  //   })
  // );
  // app.use(express.json());
  // app.use(cookieParser());

  // const ACCESS_SECRET = process.env.ACCESS_SECRET!;
  // const REFRESH_SECRET = process.env.REFRESH_SECRET!;

  // function generateTokens(payload: any) {
  //   const accessToken = jwt.sign(payload, ACCESS_SECRET, { expiresIn: "10m" });
  //   const refreshToken = jwt.sign(payload, REFRESH_SECRET, { expiresIn: "7d" });
  //   return { accessToken, refreshToken };
  // }

  // app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
  //   const { email, password } = req.body;

  //   // Dummy example
  //   if (email !== "test@example.com" || password !== "123456") {
  //     return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid credentials" });
  //   }

  //   const tokens = generateTokens({ email });

  //   res.cookie("refresh_token", tokens.refreshToken, {
  //     httpOnly: true,
  //     secure: true,
  //     sameSite: "strict",
  //     path: "/refresh"
  //   });

  //   return res.json({
  //     access_token: tokens.accessToken,
  //     message: "Login successful"
  //   });
  // });

  // app.post("/refresh", (req, res) => {
  //   const token = req.cookies.refresh_token;
  //   if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: "No refresh token" });

  //   try {
  //     const payload = jwt.verify(token, REFRESH_SECRET);
  //     const tokens = generateTokens({ email: payload.email });

  //     res.cookie("refresh_token", tokens.refreshToken, {
  //       httpOnly: true,
  //       secure: true,
  //       sameSite: "strict",
  //       path: "/refresh"
  //     });

  //     return res.json({ access_token: tokens.accessToken });
  //   } catch {
  //     return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid refresh token" });
  //   }
  // });

  // app.listen(3000, () => console.log("Server running on 3000"));
  // \`\`\`

  // This is the exact pattern used in production-level apps.

  // ---

  // # Common Mistakes Beginners Make (and How to Avoid Them)

  // ### ❌ Storing refresh tokens in localStorage  
  // → Always store in cookies.

  // ### ❌ Using long-lived access tokens  
  // → Always keep them short-lived.

  // ### ❌ Not rotating refresh tokens  
  // → Always generate a new one at each refresh.

  // ### ❌ Sending tokens in response body unnecessarily  
  // → Keep sensitive parts in cookies whenever possible.

  // ---

  // # Best Practices for Secure Cookie-Based Auth

  // - Use **httpOnly + secure + sameSite=strict** for all tokens  
  // - Use **short access tokens**  
  // - Use **refresh token rotation**  
  // - Implement **logout** by clearing cookies  
  // - Use **CSRF tokens** for extra-sensitive apps  
  // - Keep secrets in \${.env}  
  // - Use HTTPS in production  

  // Mentioning these in your GitHub README or resume automatically improves your credibility.

  // ---

  // # Conclusion

  // If you're building a TypeScript backend in 2025, then cookie-based authentication with refresh + access tokens is the safest, cleanest, and most industry-validated way to authenticate users. It gives you:

  // - Strong protection against XSS token theft  
  // - Automatic request handling via cookies  
  // - Smooth UX with silent token refresh  
  // - Full compatibility with React, Next.js, Angular, and native apps  
  // - A strong resume highlight for backend roles  

  // So ditch the outdated localStorage method and upgrade your backend authentication like a true software engineer.

  // This one improvement can make your project stand out instantly — because secure authentication is what separates hobby projects from real-world, production-ready engineering.

  // The Rise of Coding Agents: Will Developers Become AI Supervisors Instead of Coders?

  // A few years ago, the biggest productivity leap in software development was switching IDEs or adopting Git. Today, the landscape is shifting again, this time far more dramatically. Developers are starting their day not by diving into a codebase, but by reviewing work an AI agent completed overnight. Issues triaged, tests generated, PRs suggested. All done before the morning stand-up.

  // This isn’t a distant future. It’s the growing reality of modern software engineering,
  // and it raises a compelling question:
  // Are developers evolving from coders into AI supervisors?

  // In this post, we’ll explore the rise of coding agents, what’s driving their adoption, how they’re being used today, the risks involved, and how this shift may redefine what it means to be a developer.

  // ## What Are Coding Agents? A Clear Explanation

  // To understand this shift, we need to define coding agents, because they’re not just another AI tool.
  // Traditional AI coding assistants (like Copilot) or tools like Claude code, Cursor, or Windsurf help generate snippets or suggest completions or even write entire production codes. Coding agents, however, can:

  // - Plan multi-step tasks
  // - Use external tools
  // - Iterate until goals are achieved
  // - Maintain memory of the task
  // - Work independently with minimal guidance

  // They behave less like autocomplete and more like junior engineers capable of following structured instructions.
  // ## Types of Coding Agents in Modern Development

  // ### 1. Task-Specific Agents

  // Task-specific agents focus on executing a single, well-defined task consistently and accurately. They excel at automating routine development activities without involving decision-making or complex workflows.

  // **Common Use Cases:**

  // - Generating comprehensive unit and integration tests using context-aware frameworks  
  // - Summarizing or reviewing pull requests with advanced code understanding  
  // - Performing static and semantic code analysis with AI-enhanced feedback  
  // - Detecting potential security vulnerabilities using up-to-date threat models  

  // These agents act as precise tools in the developer’s toolkit, providing reliable, repeatable outputs.

  // ---

  // ### 2. Autonomous / Multi-Step Agents

  // Autonomous agents operate under broader, goal-driven instructions and perform complex sequences of actions, often involving decision-making, iteration, and adaptation.

  // **Example task:**  
  // *“Identify flaky or nondeterministic tests in the repository, fix or isolate them, and generate a detailed pull request.”*

  // **How they work:**  
  // - Analyze the entire codebase or relevant subsets using dynamic and static analysis  
  // - Detect flaky tests by executing tests under varied conditions and monitoring results  
  // - Propose or automatically implement fixes, like rewriting or isolating problematic tests  
  // - Generate patches, documentation updates, and prepare pull requests with comprehensive explanations  
  // - Optionally, collaborate with CI/CD pipelines to validate changes automatically  

  // These agents integrate multiple layers of intelligence to carry out end-to-end workflows, reducing manual effort on complex problem-solving tasks.

  // ---

  // ### Emerging Trends

  // - **Hybrid Agents:** Systems combining task-specific precision with autonomous planning for enhanced flexibility.  
  // - **Human-in-the-Loop:** Agents designed for collaboration, where they suggest actions and seek human validation.  
  // - **Context-Aware Adaptation:** Leveraging project metadata, team preferences, and runtime telemetry to optimize agent decisions.  
  // - **Explainability & Transparency:** Providing clear rationales for suggestions or changes to build developer trust.

  // ---

  // This evolving landscape highlights how coding agents are increasingly embedded within developer workflows, shifting from narrow automation to intelligent collaborators capable of managing sophisticated software engineering challenges.


  // This level of autonomy is made possible by frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, and Anthropic’s agent guidance, which enable planning, routing, tool usage, and guardrails.

  // LangChain’s State of AI Agents report highlights this trend: software teams are rapidly moving from prompt-based copilots toward structured, workflow-driven agents because they unlock deeper automation.

  // ## Why Coding Agents Are Rising Now

  // Coding agents didn’t appear out of nowhere. Several forces have combined to accelerate their adoption.

  // ### 1. Better Reasoning and Planning From New Models

  // Modern LLMs now excel at:

  // - Breaking down complex tasks
  // - Mapping out workflows
  // - Making decisions
  // - Self-correcting through iteration

  // This is critical for multi-step engineering tasks.

  // ### 2. A Mature Tooling Ecosystem

  // Two advancements matter most:

  // **LangChain & LangGraph**

  // These frameworks provide:

  // - Reliable task orchestration
  // - Controlled tool calling
  // - Guardrails for safety
  // - Memory and state management
  // - DAG-based execution flows

  // LangGraph, in particular, prevents infinite loops and enforces predictable behavior, essential for production environments.

  // **Agent Principles**

  // Anthropic emphasizes:

  // - Safe delegation
  // - Verifiable reasoning
  // - Structured workflows
  // - Multi-step evaluation

  // This keeps agent behavior understandable and trustworthy.

  // ### 3. Developers Are Overloaded

  // With growing codebases, developers spend increasing time on repetitive tasks:

  // - Triage
  // - Documentation
  // - Bug replication
  // - Writing boilerplate tests

  // Agents take over this burden.

  // ### 4. Software Complexity Has Exploded

  // Distributed systems, microservices, and hard-to-navigate codebases have become the norm. Agents help by searching repositories, generating documentation, and surfacing important dependencies.

  // ## How Code Agents Are Being Used Today

  // Here are the most common and impactful ways teams are integrating code agents into their workflows.

  // ### 1. Automated Issue Triage

  // Agents can:

  // - Read new issues
  // - Classify them
  // - Identify duplicates
  // - Suggest severity levels
  // - Assign to the appropriate team

  // This is especially effective in high-volume repos.

  // ### 2. PR Review & Suggestions

  // Agents review diffs, understand context, and flag issues such as:

  // - Performance bottlenecks
  // - Security risks
  // - Anti-patterns
  // - Potential logical errors

  // They also propose improved patches, acting like tireless secondary reviewers.

  // ### 3. Test Generation

  // One of the most loved use cases.

  // Agents:

  // - Identify untested code
  // - Generate unit and integration tests
  // - Detect edge cases
  // - Stabilize flaky tests

  // Anthropic-style guardrails help ensure generated tests are valid and meaningful.

  // ### 4. Automated Debugging Assistance

  // These agents can:

  // - Reproduce bugs
  // - Trace logs
  // - Analyze stack traces
  // - Suggest root causes
  // - Propose minimal patches

  // They significantly shorten debugging cycles.

  // ### 5. Repository Search & Documentation

  // Agents can answer questions like:

  // - “Where is this function used?”
  // - “Which modules depend on X?”
  // - “Summarize the architecture of service Y.”

  // They can also update:

  // - READMEs
  // - API documentation
  // - Internal design notes
  // - Dependency diagrams

  // This is especially helpful for onboarding.

  // ## Mini Demo: A Code Agent in Action

  // Here’s what goal-driven automation looks like in practice.

  // **Command:**
  // “Identify flaky tests and improve them.”

  // The agent’s workflow:

  // 1. Searches for test files
  // 2. Performs repeated runs
  // 3. Flags nondeterministic results
  // 4. Pinpoints likely causes
  // 5. Generates improved test logic
  // 6. Opens a PR with changes

  // The developer’s role becomes simple: review → approve → merge.

  // This is exactly how the supervisor role begins to emerge.

  // ## Why Developers Love Code Agents

  // The benefits of these agents are immediate and meaningful.

  // ### 1. Significant Productivity Gains

  // Agents eliminate the most repetitive and time-consuming engineering tasks.

  // ### 2. Higher Quality Output

  // They bring consistency to:

  // - Testing
  // - Refactoring
  // - Code inspections
  // - Documentation

  // And they rarely overlook simple mistakes.

  // ### 3. Lower Cognitive Load

  // Developers delegate routine work to agents, leaving more time for deep thinking.

  // ### 4. Around-the-Clock Progress

  // Agents operate continuously, analyzing logs, reviewing issues, or prepping PRs at any hour.

  // ### 5. More Time for High-Value Engineering

  // Developers shift toward:

  // - Architectural decisions
  // - Creative problem solving
  // - System design
  // - Agent governance

  // This makes the job more strategic.

  // ## The Risks: What You Should Watch Out For

  // Despite their potential, deploying agents requires caution.

  // ### 1. Hallucinations and Incorrect Code

  // LLMs sometimes generate plausible but wrong code. Human oversight remains essential.

  // ### 2. Security Concerns

  // Agents often require access to:

  // - Repositories
  // - Runtimes
  // - CI/CD
  // - Internal documentation

  // Without strict permission models, agents can introduce vulnerabilities.

  // This is why LangGraph’s focus on access control and guardrails is so important.

  // ### 3. Unpredictable or Runaway Behavior

  // Fully autonomous agents can:

  // - Loop indefinitely
  // - Misuse tools
  // - Modify unintended files
  // - Generate excessive actions

  // Anthropic’s guidance strongly warns against unconstrained autonomy.

  // ### 4. Overdependence on AI

  // If developers rely entirely on agents:

  // - Debugging skills fade
  // - Architectural understanding weakens
  // - Problem-solving intuition declines

  // This has long-term career implications.

  // ## What Developers Think: Real-World Perspectives

  // Opinions on agents vary widely across engineering teams.

  // **The Optimist**

  // “Agents give me back time. I can finally focus on hard problems.”

  // **The Skeptic**

  // “They’re impressive, but I still don’t trust them with critical fixes.”

  // **The Pragmatist**

  // “Great tools, but they need supervision, just like interns.”

  // **The New Grad**

  // “If agents do all the simple work, where do juniors start?”

  // These sentiments capture the excitement and uncertainty surrounding code agents.

  // ## Poll: Would You Deploy an Autonomous Code Agent?

  // Choose the option closest to your view:

  // - Yes — they’re the future.
  // - Maybe — but only with strong guardrails.
  // - No — too risky right now.
  // - I’m curious but haven’t tried them.

  // ## The Future: Are Developers Becoming AI Supervisors?

  // The rise of agents doesn’t eliminate developers, it transforms their responsibilities.

  // New roles are already emerging:

  // **Agent Reliability Engineer**

  // Ensures agents behave consistently and safely.

  // **AI Workflow Architect**

  // Designs multi-step agent workflows.

  // **Guardrail Engineer**

  // Implements safety boundaries for agent actions.

  // **PromptOps Engineer**

  // Maintains prompts, tools, and evaluation methods.

  // In this future, developers become orchestrators, guiding systems that handle the mechanical parts of coding. The shift mirrors how modern pilots supervise advanced autopilot systems but remain responsible for critical decisions.

  // ## Best Practices for Safe Deployment

  // If you plan to adopt code agents, start with these principles:

  // - Begin with task-specific agents
  // - Use LangGraph for predictable orchestration
  // - Limit permissions using least-privileged access
  // - Require human approval for merges
  // - Follow Anthropic-style safety patterns
  // - Log all agent actions
  // - Set runtime limits and guard loops
  // - Evaluate outputs continuously

  // The goal is safe, controlled augmentation—not unchecked autonomy.

  // ## Conclusion: Are We Entering the AI-Supervised Coding Era?

  // The rise of code agents signals a major shift in software engineering. The industry is moving from manually writing every line of code to supervising intelligent systems that can write, test, and maintain code on our behalf.

  // Developers aren’t being replaced, they’re being elevated.

  // They’re becoming decision-makers, reviewers, architects, and supervisors. They’re guiding, not grinding.

  // And that brings us to a final question:

  // In five years, will manual coding feel as outdated as writing assembly does today?

  // The answer depends on how willingly we embrace this new era, and how thoughtfully we implement it.

  // # CVE-2025-55182 Explained: How a Prototype Pollution Flaw in React Server Functions Led to Critical RCE

  // In late 2025, the JavaScript ecosystem faced one of its most severe security issues in recent years: **CVE-2025-55182**, a remote code execution vulnerability affecting **React Server Functions**, and by extension, frameworks like **Next.js 14+ and some versions of 15**.

  // What makes this vulnerability particularly alarming is its simplicity,  **an attacker could trigger RCE during the deserialization stage**, before the server even checks whether the incoming request targets a valid action.

  // If your application used React Server Actions (or Server Functions) and accepted multipart form-data, you were potentially exposed.

  // This post breaks down what CVE-2025-55182 really is, how CVEs work, how this specific flaw threatens modern full-stack JavaScript apps, and what you must do to secure your systems.

  // ---

  // ## What Is a CVE?

  // A **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** is an industry-standard identifier assigned to publicly known security vulnerabilities.

  // Each CVE includes:

  // - A unique ID (e.g., **CVE-2025-55182**)  
  // - A description of the vulnerability  
  // - Its severity  
  // - References to public advisories, patches, or exploits  

  // CVE-2025-55182 is classified as a **critical** vulnerability because it allows **remote code execution**.

  // ---

  // ## Understanding the Threat: Why CVE-2025-55182 Is So Dangerous

  // React Server Functions rely on an internal serialization mechanism called the **React Flight Protocol**.

  // The vulnerability arose because React **failed to validate whether referenced properties in incoming deserialization chunks were safe**, enabling **prototype pollution**.

  // Attackers could manipulate:

  // - Object prototypes  
  // - Promise/thenable behavior  
  // - React’s deserialization chain  

  // This enabled attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server **without authentication**.

  // ---

  // ## How the Vulnerability Worked (Simplified)

  // ### 1. React deserialized “chunks” sent by the client, but it didn't validate whether referenced keys were safe. This is the vulnerability.

  // ### 2. Attackers supplied magic prototype keys:

  // \`__proto__\`  
  // \`constructor\`  
  // \`constructor()\`

  // ### 3. React awaited malicious thenables  
  // Any object with a \`.then()\` method is automatically awaited.

  // ### 4. Attackers injected the Function constructor  
  // Like: \`Function("process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('rm -rf /')")\`

  // React executed it, full RCE.

  // ---

  // ## Real-World Impact

  // Affected:
  // - Next.js apps with Server Actions  
  // - Any server accepting multipart/form-data  
  // - Any environment where form uploads reached React Server Functions  

  // Consequences:

  // - Full server takeover  
  // - Credential theft  
  // - Supply chain compromise  
  // - Database extraction  

  // ---

  // ## The Fixes

  // ### ✔️ Prototype key validation  
  // Unsafe keys are rejected.

  // ### ✔️ Hardened deserialization  
  // Better reference validation and type safety.

  // ### ✔️ Sandboxing  
  // Prevent access to global constructors.

  // ### ✔️ Early action validation  
  // Server checks action *before* deserializing inputs.

  // ---

  // ## Protect Your App

  // 1. **Update React and Next.js immediately**  
  // 2. Add WAF rules blocking  
  //    - \`__proto__\`  
  //    - \`constructor\`  
  //    - \`$@\`  
  // 3. Disable Server Actions where unnecessary  
  // 4. Sanitize all multipart/form-data  
  // 5. Rotate secrets if your app was exposed  

  // ---

  // ## Final Thoughts

  // CVE-2025-55182 is a reminder that modern full-stack frameworks blur the line between client data and server behavior, making strict validation essential.

  // JavaScript’s prototype system remains powerful but dangerous when mishandled.  
  // React’s patches significantly improve safety, but developers must remain vigilant.
